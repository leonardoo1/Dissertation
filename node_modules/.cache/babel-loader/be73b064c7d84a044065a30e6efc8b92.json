Its mission is to make crypto discoverable and efficient globally by empowering retail users with unbiased, high quality and accurate information for drawing their own informed conclusions. Founded by Brandon Chez in May 2013, CoinMarketCap has quickly grown to become the most trusted source by users, institutions, and media for comparing thousands of cryptoassets and is commonly cited by CNBC, Bloomberg, and other major news outlets. (Even the U.S. government uses CoinMarketCap's data for research and reports!) In April 2020, CoinMarketCap was acquired by Binance Capital Mgmt. Binance is the global blockchain company behind the world's largest digital asset exchange by trading volume and users, which shares the common vision of making crypto accessible and systemically important to people all around the world. Through the acquisition, CoinMarketCap plans to tap into its parent company's extensive resources to acquire more in-depth data into projects, reduce information asymmetry in the crypto industry and bring higher-quality data to its hundreds of millions of users. CoinMarketCap stands firmly for accurate, timely and unbiased information. Since its acquisition by Binance in early 2020, CoinMarketCap continues to operate independently from its parent company.

Disclosure Policy In April 2020, CoinMarketCap was acquired by Binance Capital Mgmt. There is no ownership relationship between CoinMarketCap and Binance.com. Binance is the global blockchain company behind the world's largest digital asset exchange by trading volume and users, serving a greater mission to accelerate cryptocurrency adoption with 25+ products, projects and initiatives. Binance.com is known for offering a wide range of cryptoasset trading options and fiat on-ramps for multiple currencies globally, as part of its mission to increase the freedom of money. Following this acquisition, CoinMarketCap will continue to be run as an independent business entity and stays committed to providing the most accurate, timely and quality cryptocurrency data in the industry. CoinMarketCap strictly follows and enforces its independent listing criteria guidelines, circulating supply calculation methods and liquidity score for how it ranks cryptoassets. While the Binance cryptocurrency exchange and its native token BNB are listed on CoinMarketCap, CoinMarketCap and Binance are separate entities that maintain a strict policy of independence from one another: Binance has no bearing on CoinMarketCap rankings, while CoinMarketCap has no influence over Binance's operations. No Binance employee, including CZ, has control over CoinMarketCap's ranking algorithms or listing processes. Cryptoassets that wish to be listed on CoinMarketCap should follow the guidelines in our listing policy and will be fairly and independently evaluated on their merits. CoinMarketCap's official ranking criteria is designed to eliminate any possibility of preferential treatment in general, even for the Binance exchange or BNB cryptoasset. This will be enforced in spite of any positive or negative financial effect this adherence to policy might have for its parent company. CoinMarketCap and its employees do not take any public positions on the economic merits of any cryptoasset, nor do they publicly endorse any cryptoasset or blockchain project. All cryptoasset and/or project endorsements from CZ and/or Binance are unrelated to the CoinMarketCap brand and operations. CoinMarketCap will continue to present the most accurate data on cryptocurrencies to the wider public independently. We are confident that our common vision to further the crypto revolution and promote transparency in the crypto space will be strengthened by this acquisition.\"\n      }, void 0, false, {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 9,\n        columnNumber: 9\n      }, this)]\n    }, void 0, true, {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 7,\n      columnNumber: 7\n    }, this)\n  }, void 0, false, {\n    fileName: _jsxFileName,\n    lineNumber: 6,\n    columnNumber: 5\n  }, this);\n}\n\n_c = About;\nexport default About;\n\nvar _c;\n\n$RefreshReg$(_c, \"About\");","map":{"version":3,"sources":["C:/Users/laci/Desktop/Dissertation/src/Pages/About.js"],"names":["React","useEffect","useState","styles","About"],"mappings":";;AAAA,OAAOA,KAAP,IAAgBC,SAAhB,EAA2BC,QAA3B,QAA2C,OAA3C;AACA,OAAOC,MAAP,MAAmB,aAAnB;;AAEA,SAASC,KAAT,GAAiB;AACf,sBACE;AAAK,IAAA,SAAS,EAAC,iBAAf;AAAA,2BACE;AAAK,MAAA,SAAS,EAAC,OAAf;AAAA,8BACE;AAAI,QAAA,SAAS,EAAC,aAAd;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,cADF,eAEE;AAAG,QAAA,SAAS,EAAC,SAAb;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,cAFF;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AADF;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,UADF;AAsDD;;KAvDQA,K;AAyDT,eAAeA,KAAf","sourcesContent":["import React, { useEffect, useState } from \"react\";\r\nimport styles from \"./About.css\";\r\n\r\nfunction About() {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className=\"container-about\">\r\n      <div className=\"title\">\r\n        <h1 className=\"about-title\">About Us</h1>\r\n        <p className=\"history\">CoinMarketCap is the world's most-referenced price-tracking website for cryptoassets in the rapidly growing cryptocurrency space.
